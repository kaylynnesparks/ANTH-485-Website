            <p>The story that I wrote for portfolio 3 is about a bird living in a Garry Oak meadow. It is becoming severely degraded, so much so that all of his friends left the meadow to find new garry oak ecosystems to live in. A lot of the story is about Berry flying around in-between their homes. Each home is causing problems for the animals in one way or another, and the ecosystems are so fragmented that Berry has to fly for a long time to get from one to the other; these things are indicative of the unhealthy garry oak ecosystems that are scattered around the Saanich Peninsula.</p> 

<p>	I think this project was successful because how interactive it is; I made sure there were lots of options for users to choose, although it would be cooler if there were multiple endings to the story. I had a lot of plans for this Twine project but I could not figure out how to insert the audio clips I was going to create, so it became a visual experience instead of an audio-visual one. In the future. I also wish that I had made a happier ending to the story. I would have liked to expanded the story to include Berry maybe watching some ecologists restore his Garry Oak ecosystem, but I was too crunched for time and I wasnâ€™t sure how to make it interactive in an interesting way. Ultimately, a better plan and a head-start have solved these issues and I could have created a more entertaining, functional Twine story.</p>
