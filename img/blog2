           <p>Ecofeminism is a theory that draws parallels between the ways that society treats women and how society treats nature. Through this lens, one can reason that solving the environment’s problems also requires ending the oppression of women. I’d like to extend this ‘ending oppression of women’ to include the oppression of anybody within the diversity matrix, including people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, disabled, elderly, those not considered conventionally attractive, and impoverished peoples. So to sum up this idea, ending environmental crises cannot be done without ending oppression of all forms. 

Novel ecosystems theory is a concept that embraces change. It acknowledges that some ecosystems cannot be returned to a historical state, or even if they could be returned to a historical state, maybe that is not what is best. This theory does not discredit the value of historical context, rather it adds other dimensions that factor into designing restoration initiatives. This allows restorationists to achieve the best possible outcome for the communities involved, for the health of the environment, and perhaps for the economy.

To fully accept this novel ecosystem approach, it is important to value the novel ecosystems the same as the historic ecosystems. To do this, we have to resist this logic of domination that creates a hierarchy of value, and to do that successfully, we need to completely undo a logic of domination that leaches into social, political, and economic spheres as well. This will be tremendously helpful in ending oppressions, both of land and people. The question is, how?
