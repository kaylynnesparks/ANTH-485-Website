            <p>Through this project, I’ve realized how big of a role visualization plays in making a point, and there is a plethora of platforms that can be used to turn ideas into images.</p>
            <p>Voyant was by far the easiest platform to use, as there was no sign-in and you could generate a word cloud in seconds. I like the word cloud because it does a good job of expressing key concepts, but it also has a reductionist quality that simplifies the nuances that might be found in the literature being analyzing.</p>
            <p>Piktochart was also very simple to use and it allowed me to organize my thoughts in an attractive way. However, it was time consuming to make and it made me feel as though the scope of my topic had to be contained. I included links on my chart to allow for viewers to investigate further, but since the picture was saved as a PNG the links could not be linked to anything or even copy-and-pasted into a</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>search bar.</p>
            <p>I did not find Mapbox to be user-friendly at all. When I finished my map, embedding it into Github was challenging because there were multiple ways of doing it, some of which worked and others which did not. The interactivity is a nice touch, but it has to be done through a platform like Github, which made the process more challenging than it has to be. To overcome the problems that I faced with Mapbox, I contacted my professor multiple times and leaned heavily on tutorials.</p> 
            <p>I feel as though I started this project not knowing enough about the history of Garry Oak ecosystems, so I only touched on it lightly in my Piktochart before directing readers to a more valuable source. In the future, I think I’ll plan my page better before doing all of the work, because I had to reorganize and reword a lot of the work that I did before my portfolio made sense.</p>
